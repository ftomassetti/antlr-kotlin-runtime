     * The default implementation of [ANTLRErrorStrategy.sync] makes sure
     * that the current lookahead symbol is consistent with what were expecting
     * at this point in the ATN. You can call this anytime but ANTLR only
     * generates code to check before subrules/loops and each iteration.
     *
     *
     * Implements Jim Idle's magic sync mechanism in closures and optional
     * subrules. E.g.,
     *
     * <pre>
     * a : sync ( stuff sync )* ;
     * sync : {consume to what can follow sync} ;
    </pre> *
     *
     * At the start of a sub rule upon error, [.sync] performs single
     * token deletion, if possible. If it can't do that, it bails on the current
     * rule and uses the default error recovery, which consumes until the
     * resynchronization set of the current rule.
     *
     *
     * If the sub rule is optional (`(...)?`, `(...)*`, or block
     * with an empty alternative), then the expected set includes what follows
     * the subrule.
     *
     *
     * During loop iteration, it consumes until it sees a token that can start a
     * sub rule or what follows loop. Yes, that is pretty aggressive. We opt to
     * stay in the loop as long as possible.
     *
     *
     * **ORIGINS**
     *
     *
     * Previous versions of ANTLR did a poor job of their recovery within loops.
     * A single mismatch token or missing token would force the parser to bail
     * out of the entire rules surrounding the loop. So, for rule
     *
     * <pre>
     * classDef : 'class' ID '{' member* '}'
    </pre> *
     *
     * input with an extra token between members would force the parser to
     * consume until it found the next class definition rather than the next
     * member definition of the current class.
     *
     *
     * This functionality cost a little bit of effort because the parser has to
     * compare token set at the start of the loop and at each iteration. If for
     * some reason speed is suffering for you, you can turn off this
     * functionality by simply overriding this method as a blank { }.

     * `LA(1)` is not what we are looking for. If `LA(2)` has the

     * token and delete it. Then consume and return the next token (which was

     *
     *
     * This recovery strategy is implemented by [.singleTokenDeletion].
     *
     *
     * **MISSING TOKEN** (single token insertion)
     *
     *
     * If current token (at `LA(1)`) is consistent with what could come
     * after the expected `LA(1)` token, then assume the token is missing
     * and use the parser's [TokenFactory] to create it on the fly. The

     *
     * **EXAMPLE**
     *
     *
     * For example, Input `i=(3;` is clearly missing the `')'`. When
     * the parser returns from the nested call to `expr`, it will have
     * call chain:
     *
     * <pre>
     * stat  expr  atom
    </pre> *
     *
     * and it will be trying to match the `')'` at this point in the
     * derivation:
     *
     * <pre>
     * =&gt; ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
     * ^
    </pre> *
     *
     * The attempt to match `')'` will fail when it sees `';'` and
     * call [.recoverInline]. To recover, it sees that `LA(1)==';'`
     * is in the set of tokens that can follow the `')'` token reference
     * in rule `atom`. It can assume that you forgot the `')'`.

     * that there has been an identifier matched previously and that

     * this token is missing and we keep going. Because we
     * have to return some token to replace the missing token,
     * we have to conjure one up. This method gives the user control
     * over the tokens returned for missing tokens. Mostly,
     * you will want to create something special for identifier
     * tokens. For literals such as '{' and ',', the default
     * action in the parser or tree parser works. It simply creates
     * a CommonToken of the appropriate type. The text will be the token.
     * If you change what tokens must be created by the lexer,
     * override this method to create the appropriate tokens.

    /*  Compute the error recovery set for the current rule.  During
	 *  rule invocation, the parser pushes the set of tokens that can
	 *  follow that rule reference on the stack; this amounts to
	 *  computing FIRST of what follows the rule reference in the
	 *  enclosing rule. See LinearApproximator.FIRST().
	 *  This local follow set only includes tokens
	 *  from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
	 *  ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
	 *
	 *  EXAMPLE
	 *
	 *  When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
	 *  consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r.  The best
	 *  thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
	 *  can legally follow a call to r *or* any rule that called r.
	 *  You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
	 *  input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
	 *  rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
	 *
	 *  Consider grammar:
	 *
	 *  a : '[' b ']'
	 *    | '(' b ')'
	 *    ;
	 *  b : c '^' INT ;
	 *  c : ID
	 *    | INT
	 *    ;
	 *
	 *  At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
	 *  that rule is pushed on a stack.  Here are the various
	 *  context-sensitive follow sets:
	 *
	 *  FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
	 *  FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
	 *  FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
	 *
	 *  Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
	 *
	 *  a -> b -> c
	 *
	 *  and, hence, the follow context stack is:
	 *
	 *  depth     follow set       start of rule execution
	 *    0         <EOF>                    a (from main())
	 *    1          ']'                     b
	 *    2          '^'                     c
	 *
	 *  Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
	 *  been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
	 *  included.
	 *
	 *  For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
	 *  (context-sensitive or otherwise).  We need the combined set of
	 *  all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
	 *  could follow any reference in the call chain.  We need to
	 *  resync to one of those tokens.  Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
	 *  we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF.  We need to
	 *  sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
	 *  In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is ']' and in the set, so we would
	 *  not consume anything. After printing an error, rule c would
	 *  return normally.  Rule b would not find the required '^' though.
	 *  At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
	 *  exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
	 *  set).  The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
	 *  the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.  Rule b
	 *  exits normally returning to rule a.  Now it finds the ']' (and
	 *  with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
	 *
	 *  So, you can see that the parser walks up the call chain looking
	 *  for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
	 *
	 *  Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.
	 *
	 *  ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:
	 *
	 *  "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" by Niklaus Wirth
	 *
	 *  and
	 *
	 *  "A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers":
	 *  http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905
	 *
	 *  Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:
	 *
	 *  "Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent
	 *  Parsers":
	 *  ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip
	 *
	 *  Like Grosch I implement context-sensitive FOLLOW sets that are combined
	 *  at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
