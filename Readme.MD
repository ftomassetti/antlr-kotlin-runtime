# ANTLR Kotlin Runtime

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ftomassetti/antlr-kotlin-runtime.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.orgftomassetti/antlr-kotlin-runtime)

This project contains the runtime for the Kotlin target of ANTLR. This runtime is built as a multi-platform project
running on the JVM and the JS platforms. We plan to extend it to support other platforms when the multi-platform Kotlin
projects will permit so.

You will need to use ANTLR 4 and the Kotlin target to generate ANTLR Lexers and Parsers in Kotlin.
